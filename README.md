# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The example uses a simple for loop to iterate through an array, but the loop condition is incorrect, causing an attempt to access an element beyond the array's bounds. The solution shows how to correctly iterate through the array using the appropriate loop condition.
